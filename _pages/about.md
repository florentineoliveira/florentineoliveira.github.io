Welcome to my website!

I am a third year **PhD Student** at <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/" target="_blank">`Paris School of Economics`</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/maurin-eric/" target="_blank">`Ã‰ric Maurin`</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection between **Family Economics**, **Economics of Education** and **Labor Economics**.

You can find my CV <a href="assets/pdf/cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
