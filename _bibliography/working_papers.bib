  title={Children of the Revolution: Women's Liberation and Children's Success},
  author={Ã‰ric Maurin and Florentine Oliveira-Roux},
  abstract={We re-examine the effects of the women's liberation movement of the 1960s on family structures and children's outcomes. Drawing on the French experience, we show that the movement favored the advent of smaller families, where the mother works outside the home and where the risk of divorce is greater, but that the combination of these changes had little effect on the educational and occupational trajectories of the children who lived through them.},
